### Task Statment

**- Create a function that rotates the bulk magnetization vector.** <br/>
**- Plot the bulk magnetization's trajectory and generate a figure representing the results.** <br/>

## Summary about our implementation

**We used the Bloch equations as instructed to implemnet the function that could simulate the behaviour of the magnetization vector. In our simulation the magnetization vector is represented in a red line and it's compomnent in the XY-plane is in yellow line.**
