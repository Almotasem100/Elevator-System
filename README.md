# Elevator System Module

---

The project is a simple module of an elevator system controller -using 8051 Microcontroller- which could be installed to a regular elevator in any surrounding building.</br>
Our module takes into consideration the requests made by users whether they are inside the cabin or outside in any floor, then it prioritizes every request made to determine where it would stop the cabin and when to close or open the doors.</br>
The code is implemented in asembly language as a practice of using a low level language in microcontoller programming and the circuit is virtually  designed using proteus simulator.
